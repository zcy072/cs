## Environment

**Recommend using tools similar to Miniconda for environment management.**

- Platforms: Ubuntu, CUDA >= 11.8
- [Python >= 3.10](https://www.python.org/) (Recommend using [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main))
- [PyTorch >= 2.3](https://pytorch.org/)
- [BasicSR == 1.4.2](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR) **(Recommend using our implementation)**

The environment we use is: `Python == 3.10, Pytorch == 2.3, CUDA == 12.1`

### Installation

```
# Clone the repo
https://github.com/zcy072/HAFASR.git

# Install dependent packages
cd HAFASR
conda create -n hafasr python=3.10
conda activate hafasr

# Install Pytorch (for example)
pip install torch==2.3.0 torchvision==0.18.0

# Install BasicSR
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
```

## Data Preparation

Please refer to [datasets/REDAME.md](datasets/README.md) for data preparation.

## How To Test

- Refer to `./options/test` for the configuration file of the model to be tested, and prepare the testing data and pretrained model.

```
python basicsr/test.py -opt options/test/HAFASR_DF2K_x2SR.yml
```

The testing results will be saved in the `./results` folder.

## How To Train

- Refer to `./options/train` for the configuration file of the model to train.

- Preparation of training data can refer to [this page](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR/blob/master/docs/DatasetPreparation.md).

  ```
  python basicsr/train.py -opt options/train/HAFASR_DF2K_100w_x2SR.yml
  ```

  More training commands can refer to [this page](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR/blob/master/docs/TrainTest.md).

The training logs and weights will be saved in the `./experiments` folder.
